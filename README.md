Site live at [https://stefantodoran.github.io/alina-hairstylist/](https://stefantodoran.github.io/alina-hairstylist/)

## Adding Images
Navigate to the services folder by going to `src > assets > services`, 
or click [here](https://github.com/StefanTodoran/alina-hairstylist/tree/main/src/assets/services/). <br>
In the top right, click `Add file` and under the dropdown click `Upload files`. <br><br>

The image MUST be a jpeg or it will NOT show up! The image must be named '#.jpeg' where # is some number, or it will NOT show up! <br>
Do not upload an image with the same name as an existing image in the folder. Images will display in the order that
they are named. <br> (i.e. 1.jpeg first, 2.jpeg second, etc.) <br>
The number of total images in the folder is not particularly important (although any more than 18 will not show up), 
but multiples of 3 look best on desktop, and multiples of 2 look best on mobile.
